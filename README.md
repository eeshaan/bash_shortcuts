## Phoenix Shortcuts!

These are my public shortcuts, in my tiny bash shortcut module system.

To import a .aliases file, `source [path]` in the .bashrc. If it's not in the
bash rc, it will invalidate existing profile.

Clone this into `~/shortcut` is recommended. A lot of things may slightly
break if you don't, but you could easily modify the files to fix that.
